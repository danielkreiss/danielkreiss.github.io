# Compliance, Security & Governance

I own security and compliance as operational disciplines embedded into IT architecture and daily operations. My focus is on translating regulatory requirements into enforceable technical controls, sustainable processes, and clear accountability across infrastructure, identity, and access layers.

This approach ensures compliance is durable, auditable, and aligned with business execution—not a reactive or one-time exercise.

## Regulatory Frameworks & Alignment

- NIST SP 800-171
- CMMC Level 2
- Government-adjacent and regulated environments
- Identity-driven access control and auditability

I work closely with security leadership, compliance stakeholders, and executive teams to ensure regulatory requirements are interpreted correctly and implemented in ways that withstand audit scrutiny.

## Control Implementation & Enforcement

My approach emphasizes **practical enforcement**, not checkbox compliance:

- Identity and access control aligned to least-privilege principles
- Certificate-based authentication and RADIUS enforcement
- Device compliance and conditional access governance
- Network segmentation and boundary protection
- Centralized logging, monitoring, and evidence collection

Controls are designed to be enforceable, repeatable, and operationally sustainable.

## Audit Readiness & Evidence Management

I lead audit preparation by ensuring:

- Policies and procedures reflect actual technical enforcement
- Systems are hardened consistently and verifiably
- Evidence can be produced without operational disruption
- Findings are addressed through sustainable remediation plans

This reduces audit risk while strengthening overall system resilience.

## Incident Response & Risk Management

Security incidents are treated as leadership moments. I have led recovery and remediation efforts following ransomware events, balancing technical response, operational continuity, and executive communication.

Risk decisions are deliberate, documented, and aligned with business priorities.

## Governance Philosophy

Effective compliance programs succeed when:
- Controls have clear ownership
- Enforcement is automated where possible
- Exceptions are rare, documented, and reviewed
- Security enables operations instead of blocking them

This philosophy supports secure, compliant, and agile organizations.
